## 3. Election-Audit Summary: 
This script can be used for many future elections, with a modification to who the candidates are. It is beneficial, because it shows voter turnout by county. This can help candidates figure out which counties are most influential in the outcome of the election and maybe try to get other counties to vote more. For future elections we can also see the new candidates breakdown of votes from the total votes cast. This script ultimately provides a clean breakdown of important statistics for any election.
